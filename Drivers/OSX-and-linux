No drivers are required to use Smoothie on OSX and Linux. 

However on Linux a few things will make your life easier ( but are not required/necessary ).

Here is a copy of the http://smoothieware.org/linux-drivers page : 


This is optional, but makes things more convenient…

create a file /etc/udev/rules.d/90-smoothie.rules and add the following to it…

    SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1d50", ATTRS{idProduct}=="6015", MODE="0666"
    SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1d50", ATTRS{idProduct}=="6015", SYMLINK+="smoothie%n"

under fedora, smoothieboard is handled by the modem manager (as an openmoko).
To avoid this , add in the udev rule :

    ENV{ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE}="1"

Then plug in Smoothie, and it should appear as /dev/smoothie0
if you have two USB serial devices configured the second one will be /dev/smoothie1

if you want to be able to talk to the /dev/smoothie0 with your regular non-superuser login then you need to add your user to the dialout group.
To be able to flash via DFU as a regular user then add the user to the plugdev group too
This can be done either with.

    sudo adduser <username> dialout
    sudo adduser <username> plugdev

or

    sudo vigr

and add the username to the end of the line for dialout and plugdev
