Hello and welcome to your new Smoothieboard !

You can find documentation here : http://smoothieware.org/ or on this SD card if you are offline.

To help you in your adventure, we put some files on this SD card for you.

A short guide to the folders : 

* Software contains Windows, Mac and Linux versions of Pronterface ( host software ), Slic3r ( slicing software ) and CURA ( host and slicing software ), as well as their source code, and documentation when available
* Drivers contains the drivers you must install for Windows to recognize your board, as well as some ( optional ) instructions for Linux
* Source contains the Smoothie firmware's source code
* Documentation contains a static version of the smoothieware.org website for your off-line enjoyement
* Backup-Firmware contains a copy of the firmware.bin for restoration if you flash a bad one for some reason
* Models/Calibration contains some common calibration parts
* Models/Smoothie contains various Smoothie-related parts, including enclosures

All of this is also easily available online, but these could be convenient if you don't have internet access for some reason. Or simply if you don't want to have to download something. Obviously on-line versions are prefered as they will be more up to date.

Smoothie is configured simply by editing the "config" file you can also find on this SD card, and resetting the board.

There are also guides that will help you get started : 

* http://smoothieware.org/3d-printer-guide
* http://smoothieware.org/CNC-Mill-guide
* http://smoothieware.org/laser-cutter-guide

Quick-start guide : 
 
* If you are running Windows, install the drivers ( http://smoothieware.org/windows-drivers or find them on this SD card )
* Install some host software like Pronterface or Cura ( also found on this SD card )
* Connect your USB cable to Smoothieboard and to your computer
* In your host software, check that Smoothieboard allows you to connect
* Now read the guide specific to your machine to find out how to wire it and configure it

Good practices : 
* Always check the polarity of all your connections before providing power to your Smoothieboard
* Unmount ( "eject" menu in Windows ) your Smoothieboard from your filesystem after writing something to it, and before printing with it
